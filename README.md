#Odd Socks

A general purpose websocket server and remote setup.

Use cases:

* Controlling vlc/itunes/anything from a mobile web interface.
* Want to have a mobile based remote for web-based/html5 slides? Here you go.

All web/websocket based, no painfully shitty apps to install and setup and crap.

More coming soon.
